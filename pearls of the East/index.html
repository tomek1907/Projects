            Hong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island from Xin'an County at the end of the First Opium War in 1841 then again in 1842. The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898. British Hong Kong was occupied by Imperial Japan from 1941 to 1945 during World War II; British administration resumed after the surrender of Japan. The whole territory was transferred to China in 1997. As one of China's two special administrative regions (the other being Macau), Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of "one country, two systems".</a>

            Until 1971, the Republic of China was one of the founding members of the United Nations. The rapprochement of People's China and the USA in the early 1970s and the pressure of the PRC authorities meant that the Republic of China is now recognized by only 14 countries (including the Vatican, Paraguay and economically underdeveloped island countries of the Pacific region, countries of Central America and the Caribbean Sea). In 1999–2001, it was also recognized by Macedonia in exchange for financial assistance (the so-called dollar diplomacy). Since January 1, 2002, the Republic of China has been a member of the WTO under the name of the Separate Customs Area of ​​Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.
